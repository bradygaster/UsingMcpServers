Create a new Azure Open AI resource in my Azure subscription, in a new resource group, and use random names for the resources and group. Then add a gpt-4o-mini model deployment to that resource instance. Once the resources have been provisioned, set the AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT user secret to be the new Azure OpenAI instance's endpoint for the TranslationAgent project. My code optimizes for security and best practices when creating and managing Azure resources, so please don't use any secrets and connect to resources using managed identity.
